## Overview

This is a simple sudoku solver written in Java. Future plans include a full UI, along with a way to upload photos to be read by the solver.

As it stands, the solver has a hardcoded sudoku example that it is solving.

The initial version of this was made in the span of about 4 hours, including planning design and coding, over the span of 2 evenings.
